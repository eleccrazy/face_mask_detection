# Model Folder

## Overview
This folder contains all files related to the machine learning model, including the trained model, datasets, and training scripts. It serves as the backbone for the mask detection logic implemented in the application.

## Contents
- `dataset/`: Datasets used for training and testing.
- `evaluation_metrics/`: Scripts for evaluating model performance.
- `model_training.py`: Script for training the model.
- `model_utils.py`: Helper functions for model operations.

**Note**: This README will be updated with more detailed instructions and documentation as the project progresses.
